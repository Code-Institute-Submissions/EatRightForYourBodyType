# Eat Right For Your Body Type
## An informational website for athletic people who want to refine their diet to match their body type 
This project was created as part of the Usercentric Frontend module of the [Fullstack Developer training at Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma-uk)



## UX
The user experience was about providing information in a clear and non-technical way for the user, and to provide a practical way to move forward.  
It aimed to outline what body types are, and what the user can do with this knowledge.
The user will also be able to download a PDF to get a more detailed explanation of their body type and some nutritional guidelines.

During the design phase of this project, I decided that the visual design would use illustrations of the different body types in order to explain each one visually.  This is a fast way to explain a complex list of characteristics.  The accompanying text would then provide additional clarification and detail for the user.  The layout would be a simple, one-page scrolling design, which uses a mobile-first approach to responsive design.  This adds to the simplicity of use.
A navigation bar at the top would provide jump-links to each section, so that a user could easily find the information they wanted, which is especially important on subsequent visits to the site.  It also would include a prominent call-to-action, which is the primary aim of the site's interaction with the business - to apply for a free consultation.
The free consultation is the only CTA on-page, as this leads the user to that one, single outcome - to interact with the business and become a client.

On that basis, I created a list of requirements:

###Requirements:
1. Include a section that briefly explains the concept of body types and the three main categories using a description and image
2. Explain each body type and it’s characteristics, so that the visitor can identify which type they are
3. Provide suggestions for how the visitor can adapt their diet to suit their individual body type
4. Provide additional information for people who don’t fall neatly into one of the 3 main categories
5. Explain the limitations of the body type model and why it’s not a ‘final destination’.  A person can always improve their body composition despite their body type
6. Allow visitors to download a PDF with some simple guidelines for body-type eating
7. Provides an option to sign up for a nutritional consultation if they want to know more (contact form)
8. Has social sharing links
9. Includes a disclaimer


On this basis, a wireframe was created https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VlI0Lawn036panhtLn8AMDetkrfStmhq

## Features
The site has a hero-style image at the top of the page, with a strapline that describes what the site is about and who it is for.

It then has a 60 second explainer video which explains the site's purpose in a little more detail in an easily-digestible way.

There is a section that describes each body type, and provides a download link to a customised PDF for each body type


##Testing
I tested this site thoraghally, making sure all functionality was working correctly
